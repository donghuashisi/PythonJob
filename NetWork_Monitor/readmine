we need to build a neurons network to automaticlly monitor the state of network 

problem 1 : is it a  Supervised learning  or  Nosupervised learning?

problem 2 : does the input parameters including detailed information such as details of each protocol even package port and ip address?
             or just some general parameters such packet rate,max packet rate,min packet rate QFP cpu load ......
             
             
             But thinking about the original intention of neural network design,it is a intelligent system to learn just like human,regardless of what or which situation to learn.
             So the neruns network is used to learning everything by itself,regardless of the background.
             The only prerequisite is that the data we provide for the neruns network should  hide the logical relation of something or thing in the real world
             I think it is the redundancy between the data.
